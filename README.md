# Working-on-Support-Vector-Machines
Support Vector Machines abbreviated as SVM, are supervised learning models which are used for distinctly classifying data points. The goal is to find a hyperplane that has the maximum margin. If the number of input features is 2, then this hyperplane becomes a line and If the number of input features is 3, then the hyperplane becomes a two-dimensional plane. It becomes difficult to imagine when the number of features exceeds 3.
